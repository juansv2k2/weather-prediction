# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## Project Overview

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using advanced ensemble methods. This project demonstrates the progression from simple baseline models to sophisticated ensemble techniques, showcasing how **Bagging** and **Random Forest** algorithms can significantly improve prediction accuracy over individual decision trees.

**Key Achievement**: Developed an ensemble model that outperforms naive baseline predictors by leveraging bootstrap sampling and feature randomization techniques.

## Business Problem

Weather prediction is crucial for agriculture, event planning, and daily decision-making. This project tackles the binary classification challenge of predicting rain occurrence using historical weather patterns from Australian meteorological data.

**Dataset**: [Australian Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) (~145k observations)  
**Target**: RainTomorrow (binary: Yes/No)  
**Features**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind measurements, and more

### Class Distribution Analysis

The dataset shows a natural imbalance typical in weather prediction:

_Approximately 77% "No Rain" vs 23% "Rain" - a realistic representation of Australian weather patterns that creates the foundation for baseline model comparisons._

## 🎯 Project Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

**Smart Data Cleaning Strategy:**

- Removed features with >50% missing values (Sunshine, Evaporation, Cloud measurements)
- Eliminated location and date dependencies for model generalization
- Applied correlation analysis to reduce multicollinearity
- Strategic feature selection based on domain knowledge

**Final Feature Set:** 16 numerical weather measurements including MaxTemp, MinTemp, Humidity levels, Pressure readings, and Wind speeds.

### Feature Correlation Analysis

_Correlation analysis reveals strong relationships between temperature measurements and pressure readings, guiding strategic feature selection to reduce multicollinearity._

### 2. Baseline Model Establishment

Before implementing complex algorithms, established simple benchmarks:

- **"Always No Rain" Model**: 77.4% accuracy (class frequency baseline)
- **"Always Rain" Model**: 22.6% accuracy

These baselines provide context for evaluating ensemble improvements.

### 3. Manual Bagging Implementation

**Core Innovation**: Built bagging from scratch to demonstrate understanding of ensemble mechanics.

**Process:**

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Created 10 diverse training subsets using random sampling with replacement
2. **Weak Learner Training**: Trained individual decision trees (intentionally allowed to overfit)
3. **Prediction Aggregation**: Averaged probabilities across all models
4. **Threshold Application**: Converted averaged probabilities to binary predictions

**Key Insight**: Individual trees showed high variance (~85-95% accuracy range), but ensemble achieved consistent ~82% accuracy.

### 4. Advanced Random Forest Analysis

**Feature Importance Discovery:**
